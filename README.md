# javascriptPractice

This is the final output of the javascript exercise from the foundations course in The Odin Project.

REFLECIONS:
It was fun to come up with algorithms to solve each problem. Covered all the exercises mentioned on the exercise page except for the caeser code exercise.
When I compared my answers with the solutions given, I saw how in many cases the solution was achieved through simple and efficient means. Have taken due note of such things. 
I also noticed a few discarded exercies in the solutions (discarded due to its complexity). 

Maybe after a few more chapters, I will try to tackle those exercies along with the caeser code challenge.

Overall, it's been a fun experience. :)
